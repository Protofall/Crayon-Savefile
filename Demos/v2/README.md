# IMPORTANT

Even though the repo is public and the library itself is fully functional, some parts of this repo are still a WIP. You need to manually build the library, navigate to REPO_ROOT/libCrayonSavefile and run the scons command mentioned in REPO_ROOT/README.md.

To build the demo here currently scons will build the PC version in `programs/` and make does DC in the Demo's root. Eventually they'll both use the scons similar to the library creation script.

# IMPORTANT

The 3rd version of the demo. In order to build run `scons PLATFORM=[INSERT_NAME_HERE]`. If you want to build all platforms, just specify "all". If the library isn't built yet, this script will build it too.

The final executables/images are in `programs/platform/`. For linux/mac/windows this is a normal executable, for Dreamcast it is a cdi. If you wish to use the elf instead for Dreamcast, you can find it in `build/dreamcast/`

# IMPORTANT

Even though the repo is public and the library itself is fully functional, some parts of this repo are still a WIP. You need to manually build the library, navigate to REPO_ROOT/libCrayonSavefile and run the scons command.

To build the demo here currently scons will build the PC version and make does DC. Eventually they'll both use the scons similar to the library creation script.

DO NOTE: ATM for this demo you can't build PC when DC intermediate files are present and vica-versa. Later on this will be fixed
